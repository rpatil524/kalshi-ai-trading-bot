Market price normalization utilities.

Kalshi API v2 changed price fields from cent-based integers
(yes_ask, yes_bid, no_ask, no_bid) to dollar-based floats
(yes_ask_dollars, yes_bid_dollars, no_ask_dollars, no_bid_dollars).

This module provides a single helper that normalizes both formats
to dollar values (0.0–1.0), plus a guard for non-tradeable
collection/aggregate tickers (issue #42).
